# Bussiness_Meeting_Summarization_using_NLP_
Ever got stuck in a situation, where everyone wants to see a summary not full reports. Well, I face it during my school and college days where we spend a lot of time preparing a whole report but the teacher only has time to read the summary. Summarization has risen as an inexorably helpful way to tackle the issue of data over-burden. Extracting information from conversations can be of very good commercial and educational value. This can be done by feature capture of the statistical, linguistic, and sentimental aspects with the dialogue structure of the conversation. Manually changing the report to a summed up form is too time taking, isn’t that so? But one can rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to achieve that. Text summarization using deep learning can understand the context of the entire text. Isn’t it a dream come true for all of us who need to come up with a quick summary of a document !!
